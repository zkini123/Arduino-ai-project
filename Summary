Our project is a Timer/Voice-Controlled Fan system. The system prompts the user—via voice or text display—to set a timer for how long the fan should run when a light is turned on. The fan automatically turns off when the timer expires or when the light is turned off. My specific addition to this project is adding a optional temperature control function, where the fan will turn on automatically if above the entered temperature.
